I'll primarily be living in a college town, but will be driving home once every month on the highway for three hours at a time.So far I've looked at the Honda Civic coupe (2016-2017), the Toyota Yaris iA (2017), the Toyota 86, and the Corolla. My budget is preferrably less than 15k, and my parents prefer the car has less than 40k miles on it, so pretty much most of the newer civics in the area are out of the question."

            "content": "I plan on traveling/moving out of the US in a few (2-3) years so I don't think I will own the car for a while. Initially I was thinking of buying with cash a 2016 Honda Civic for around 18k max and driving it until I leave but I was curious if leasing would be an option too. I think having monthly payments would work better for me as I can invest the rest and a lease of 2-3 years would be a good time frame. In addition, I can probably get a luxury car like Mercedes, Audi and won't have to deal with the hassle of selling later."
